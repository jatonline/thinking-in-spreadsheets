In this talk from the CMIP6 Data Hackathon 2021, I give an overview of some of the best practices to follow when coding
for reproducible research.

About the Hackathon: The [CMIP6 Data Hackathon](https://cmip6moap.github.io) was a three-day virtual event organised by
the University of Bristol’s [Cabot Institute](https://bristol.ac.uk/cabot/) and [Jean Golding Institute](https://bristol.ac.uk/golding/),
in association with the Met Office and universities of Exeter, Leeds and UCL. Researchers from across the UK came
together to produce cutting-edge research on topic ranging from climate change to oceanography, biogeochemistry, and
more, using data from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6).
